# react-native-icon-badge
app icon badge designed for react native

This plugin now (since version 1.1.0) supports android and IOS.

#### ps: IOS icon badge setting requires PushNotificationIOS in react native. So make sure you do have PushNotificationIOS (you can find it in your react-native modules libraries folder) linked in your XCode project.

## Methods:

### setIconBadge(number)
 set icon badge to the given value

### getBadgeNumber()
  return a promise contains the current badge number

### clearBadge()
  clear icon badge

If you have any question, please send an issue and I would help you as I can.
